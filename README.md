# name-gender-dictionary
This dictionary contains a dictionary of names and their common genders as values. The names extracted for this dictionary are extracted from Commonsense Norm Bank (CNB) dataset as introduced by Jiang et al. (2022).
This dictionary is based in gender-from-name dictionary: https://github.com/Bemmu/gender-from-name. Additional names were added partly by using ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2024)to assign gender labels to names extracted from CNB, and partly added manually.
